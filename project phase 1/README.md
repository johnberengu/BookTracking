### Book tracking
This project is a Book Management Application that allows users to search for books, view results from the Google Books API, manage a reading list, and submit feedback. It uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including fetching data from an external API, dynamic DOM manipulation, and adding/removing books from two lists: "Currently Reading" and "Done Reading."
Features

# Book Search:
        Users can search for books by title using the Google Books API.
        The results display the book's title, authors, and cover image (if available).
        If no results are found, a message is shown to notify the user.

# Currently Reading List:
        Users can add books to a "Currently Reading" list by typing the book title and clicking the "Add" button.
        The list is dynamically updated, and users can clear all items with the "Clear" button.

# Done Reading List:
        Users can add books to a "Done Reading" list by typing the book title and clicking the "Add" button.
        The list is dynamically updated.

# Feedback Form:
        Users can submit feedback about the app via a form. After submission, a confirmation alert appears with the entered feedback.

# UI Interactions:
        A toggle button shows or hides the "Library" section.
        Real-time search functionality: the search results update as the user types in the search box.
